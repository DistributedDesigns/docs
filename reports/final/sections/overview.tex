\begin{Overview}

The goal of the project was to build a distributed day trading system, with a focus on performance. The client original stated the following actions as business requirements:

\begin{itemize}
  \item View their account
  \item Add money to their account
  \item Get a stock Quote
  \item Buy a number of shares in a stock
  \item Sell a number of shares in a stock they own
  \item Set an automated sell point for a stock
  \item Set a automated but point for a stock
  \item Review their complete list of transactions
  \item Cancel a specified transaction prior to its being committed
  \item Commit a transaction
\end{itemize} 

Additionally, the overall architectural goals of the system were:
\being{itemize}
  \item Minimum transaction processing times. 
  \item Full support for required features. 
  \item Reliability and maintainability of the system. 
  \item High availability and fault recoverability (i.e. proper use of fault tolerance) 
  \item Minimal costs (development, hardware, maintenance, etc.) 
  \item Clean design that is easily understandable and maintainable. 
  \item Appropriate security 
  \item A clean web-client interface. 
\end{itemize}

These requirements form the basis for the distributed daytrading system commissioned by DayTrading Inc.
